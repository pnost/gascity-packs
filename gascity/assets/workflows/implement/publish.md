If push {{push}} or open_pr {{open_pr}} are explicit opt-ins, publish only
after the direct implementation summary has completed successfully. Resolve the
publish report from summary_path {{summary_path}} when set; otherwise read the
`gc.implementation.summary_path` value recorded by the summarize step in
workflow root metadata. Fail closed if no absolute summary report path is
available.

Direct implement does not run gap-analysis or review loops. Treat this as an
explicit caller authorization to publish the direct implementation result, and
use the same protected-branch, lease-safe push, sanitized PR title/body, and
collision checks as the pack publish helper. If neither push nor open_pr is an
explicit opt-in, close with `gc.outcome=pass` without mutating remotes.
