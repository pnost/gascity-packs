Verify the new Superpowers task test fails for the expected reason.

Run the focused command recorded by the failing-test step from the task
worktree. Confirm the test fails because the required behavior is missing, not
because of syntax errors, missing imports, an invalid fixture, or a bad command.

If the failure is wrong, fix only the test and run it again until it fails for
the intended reason. Record the command, relevant output, and corrected failure
reason in the task summary.

Do not invoke provider-native subagents or upstream plugin runtime commands.
