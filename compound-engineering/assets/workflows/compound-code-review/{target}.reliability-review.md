Review reliability with the adapted Compound Engineering agent:

`compound-engineering.ce-reliability-reviewer`

Use the installed reliability reviewer persona as source material. Check
retries, timeouts, background work, lifecycle transitions, operational failure
paths, and recovery behavior when relevant to the diff. Return structured
findings for synthesis.

Read `gc.build.code_review_context_path` from the workflow root. Write this lane
artifact to `{{artifact_root}}/code-review/reliability.md`. Close with
`gc.outcome=pass`, `code_review.review_verdict=approve|iterate`, and
`code_review.lane_report_path=<lane artifact path>`. Do not set
`code_review.verdict` or `code_review.report_path`; the apply-review-findings
lane owns the final loop verdict consumed by the approval check.

Do not invoke provider-native subagents. You are the Gas City lane for this persona.
